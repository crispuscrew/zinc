  # instead of building them by hand. This exists for ZDE, which is a NixOS product: without
  # it there is no zc or zcr on a ZDE machine at all, and everything ZDE wants from Zinc is
  # unreachable regardless of whether Zinc implements it.
  #
  # This is a SECOND way to build the binaries, and the repo's first golden rule is that tool
  # builds are podman-only. That rule is about how Zinc builds and tests itself: `make check`
  # and `make repro` in the digest-pinned container stay the gate, and this flake is not
  # allowed to become the thing that decides whether a change is good. What it is for is
  # consumers - a flake input a desktop can pin. Nixpkgs pins the Go toolchain by hash the
  # same way the Containerfile pins it by digest, so both paths are reproducible; they are
  # just reproducible against different pins, and only one of them gates the repo.
