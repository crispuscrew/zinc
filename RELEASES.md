| 0.11.0  | Schema v4 and consumers | unified app fields, provisioned packet networking, encrypted DNS, directional audio broker, external VM options, Go 1.26 builds |
| ...     |                |                       |

**0.10.0 is a minor bump, not a patch.** It changes the app-config schema, so every existing
config needs editing: the version line, and the audio and Configs blocks. Under semantic
versioning a change that invalidates what users already have on disk cannot be a patch, and
calling it 0.9.2 would tell people the upgrade is safe to take without reading anything. The
migration is in the changelog.

**0.11.0 is a breaking pre-1.0 minor release.** Schema v4 changes persisted app
definitions and runtime prerequisites. Read the [release notes](docs/releases/0.11.0.md)
and [migration guide](docs/migration.md) before upgrading networked or VM apps.

## Cutting a release

Merge reviewed feature work into `dev`, then cut a fresh `release/0.11.0` branch
from `dev`. Release changes reach `main` through a reviewed PR with green CI.
On the final reviewed release commit, create the signed tag:

```
make -f release.mk tag VERSION=X.Y.Z # signed, annotated tag
```

The tag is signed, and this refuses rather than falling back to an unsigned one: a release that
silently was not signed is worse than one that failed to be, because only the first is invisible.
It needs `git config user.signingkey` (with `gpg.format=ssh` for an SSH key).

Pushing the tag builds every tool in its pinned container, verifies the reported version, and
publishes Linux AMD64 binaries plus `SHA256SUMS`. A new release stays draft until every asset is
attached. The checksum is deliberately not made by whoever cuts the tag: a checksum written on the
machine that also built the binaries proves only that the machine agrees with itself. CI also runs
`make repro` for every module, so anyone can rebuild and compare the published bytes.

Version numbers live in four places that move together: `flake.nix`, the assertion in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the table above, and `docs/quickstart.md`. Finalizing a release also
moves its notes from `Unreleased` to a dated heading in `CHANGELOG.md`.

**ZDE** (the Zinc Desktop Environment, `zde-niri` / `zde-hypr`) is a separate project
layered on Zinc: it lives in its own repository with its own release plan. Only the Zinc
core and its tools (containers, launchers, virtualization) are released from here.
