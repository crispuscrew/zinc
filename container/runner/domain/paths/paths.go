// Package paths decides two things a container app needs agreed in exactly one place: what
// an instance of an app is called, and where that instance keeps its state.
//
// Both exist because one app definition can be run more than once - a browser for work and
// one for personal are the same config and must not be the same running thing. The address
// "app@instance" is what a person types; the runtime name and the state directory are
// derived from it, here, so `zcr run` creates what `zcr stop` removes and `zcr where`
// reports.
//
// It is pure string work over the environment, so the layout is unit-testable and no caller
// has to reimplement it. That last part is the point: a desktop that hardcodes the layout
// becomes a second source of truth the moment either side changes, which is why `zcr where`
// exists rather than a documented constant.
