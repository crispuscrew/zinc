package options

// HostOptions carries the host-side values a launch needs - Wayland/runtime
// sockets, the theme bundle, the terminal emulator, the netfilter image, and the
// container-side home. They are passed explicitly so the argv-building adapters
// never read the environment themselves and stay pure/testable. Empty fields
// disable the corresponding wiring. The host adapter (adapters/host) resolves these
// from the environment; tests and dry-runs construct them directly.
type HostOptions struct {
	RuntimeDir     string   // host XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (wayland/pipewire sockets)
	WaylandDisplay string   // host WAYLAND_DISPLAY, e.g. "wayland-1"
	ThemeBundleDir string   // host path to the generated curated theme bundle (section 5.6)
	NetfilterImage string   // image carrying nft for the pasta lock-down step (section 5.3); empty → adapter default
	HomeDir        string   // container-side home for key mounts (.ssh/.gnupg); empty → /root
	Terminal       []string // terminal-emulator argv for terminal apps, e.g. ["foot"] or ["xterm","-e"] (section 11)
	// SessionBusPath is the host path of the real session bus socket, read out of
	// DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS (the "unix:path=" form). Only the D-Bus proxy sees it; the
	// app never does. Empty disables DBusMeta wiring, which fails the launch of an app that
	// asked for a bus rather than starting it without one.
	SessionBusPath string
	// WaylandSocket is the host path of the Wayland socket to bind-mount into the app: the
	// per-instance one a wp_security_context_v1 was attached to (section 5.2). Empty means
	// mount the compositor's own socket, which is what an app that opted out gets and what
	// everything gets on a compositor that does not implement the protocol.
	//
	// It is the one field here that is a RESULT rather than a fact about the host: the launch
	// path fills it in per app, after the context has actually been created, so an argv can
	// never claim a socket that was never made.
	WaylandSocket string
