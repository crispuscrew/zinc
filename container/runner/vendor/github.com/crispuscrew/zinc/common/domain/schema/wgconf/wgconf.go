// Package wgconf reads a wg-quick-format WireGuard config into the parts the runner needs
// to build the interface itself. Pure: it parses text and performs no I/O.
//
// It exists because `wg setconf` and wg-quick do not accept the same file. wg-quick is a
// shell script that reads Address, DNS, MTU and the script hooks, strips them, and hands the
// rest to `wg setconf`. Zinc does the stripping here instead, in Go, where what is accepted
// and what is refused can be stated and tested - rather than shipping wg-quick, which wants
// to be root, rewrite resolv.conf, and run whatever the file tells it to.
