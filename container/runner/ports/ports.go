// Package ports declares the contracts between the runner's application core (app)
// and the outside world (adapters/*). It is the hexagon's boundary: the app layer
// depends only on these interfaces, never on a concrete podman/nft/fs
// implementation, so a mechanism can be swapped by writing a new adapter - the
// motivating case being egress enforcement (NetEnforcer), where "not pasta" later is
// one more adapter, not a cross-cutting edit (docs/architecture.md section 5.3, section 13).
//
// ports depends only on pure types - the shared schema (common) and the runner's own
// HostOptions - and performs no I/O itself.
