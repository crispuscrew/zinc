// several transports (unix:, tcp:, autolaunch:, and unix:abstract= among them), and the proxy
// needs a filesystem socket it can bind-mount. An abstract socket has no path to mount, and a
// tcp bus is not something to hand a sandbox by inference. Empty makes the launch of an app
// that asked for a bus fail and say so, which is the fail-closed answer; the alternative -
// starting it with no bus - looks like the app is broken.
//
// The fallback is the standard rootless location, $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus, which is where the

	// "unix:guid=...,path=..." address all resolved to $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus, so a user who
	// had deliberately pointed the session at a nested or restricted bus (dbus-run-session,
	// a test bus) got a sandbox proxied onto the MAIN user bus instead - strictly more than
