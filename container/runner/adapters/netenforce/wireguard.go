// It runs in the same privileged helper as the ruleset, with NET_ADMIN and nothing else, and
// it exits before the app is started. That is the point of the whole feature: a tunnel needs
// NET_ADMIN to exist, an app with NetworkLists may never hold NET_ADMIN (it could flush the
// ruleset that contains it), and so before this a gateway could only ever be a NAT hop. The
// capability lives in a container that is gone by the time the app exists.
//
// The private key travels on STDIN. Not in the argv, which every process on the host can
// read out of /proc; not in the image; not in a mount the app could open. The same channel
// the nft ruleset already uses.
