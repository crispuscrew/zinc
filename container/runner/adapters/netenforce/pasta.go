// Package netenforce holds the NetEnforcer adapter - the swappable egress mechanism.
// It implements ports.NetEnforcer: how the app container attaches to the network
// (RunFlags), what must happen to establish and LOCK the netns before the app starts
// (Prepare), and how to tear it down (Teardown).
//
// One mechanism ships today: an app's NetworkLists are enforced as an nftables
// allow/deny ruleset on the app's own pasta netns (a pod). An app with no
// NetworkLists gets --network none. A future mechanism - eBPF egress, a proxy
// sidecar, an external traffic controller - is one more file here implementing the
// same interface; nothing in app or the podman runtime changes (docs section 5.3, section 13).
//
// Scope (this build): self-scoped egress lists (Host=false, empty AppName), tier-3 LAN
// publishing (Ingress && Host - an nft input chain plus pod `-p` forwards), and tier-2
// sibling links (a private --internal bridge per producer, interface-gated per-port nft;
// a producer's self-scoped ingress + a consumer's egress naming its AppName). checkNetwork
// forbids mixing tier-2 with other networking, and still rejects host-scoped egress and
// gateway (multi-homing) lists before this adapter runs.

// --- counters (section 5.3) ---
//
// Every rule that answers a policy question carries a `counter` statement and a comment
// naming it, so `zcr net <app>` can report what the ruleset has actually seen without
// rebuilding nft syntax out of `nft -j` output. The comment is the label; the chain and the
// verdict the readout shows come from the JSON itself.
//
// What is counted is a deliberate subset, because a counter on every rule buries the two
// numbers worth reading. `oif "lo"` (the app talking to itself) and `ct state
// established,related` (every packet of every flow already allowed) are between them almost
// all the traffic and say nothing about policy, so both stay bare. So do the DNS accepts to
// the resolvers the app declared, the forward chain's accepts (that traffic is a sibling's,
// and the sibling's own counters already show it leaving) and the nat rules (a rewrite is
// not a decision to allow or refuse). What is left is exactly the decisions:
//
//   - every rule a NetworkList produced, labelled with that list's index in the config, so
//     "which of my rules is actually being used" has an answer pointing at a line;
//   - the DNS deny, which is how an app carrying a hardcoded resolver announces itself;
//   - the default-drop backstop below, which is the whole "what is my sandbox refusing".
//
// One consequence is worth knowing before reading a number: the conntrack accept sits above
// all of these and is bare, so an accept counter counts the packets that OPENED flows, not
// the traffic those flows carried. That is the more useful reading ("was this rule
// exercised, and how often"), and it is why the byte column is small.

// labelPolicy names the trailing rule that makes a chain's default policy countable.
