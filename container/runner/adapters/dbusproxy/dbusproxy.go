// Package dbusproxy is the D-Bus adapter: it implements ports.DBusBroker by running
// xdg-dbus-proxy in a container Zinc owns, so an app with DBusMeta gets a session bus
// carrying only the names its config named (docs/architecture.md section 5.7).
//
// The shape is the same one the egress lock-down uses: the dangerous thing is established
// outside the app and the app is handed only the filtered result. Two properties are load
// bearing, and both are about what the app can reach rather than what it is allowed to call.
//
// The proxy is NOT in the app's pod. A pod shares the PID namespace, so a proxy inside it
// would be a process the app could signal or ptrace - the filter and the thing being
// filtered, in one blast radius. It is a standalone container instead, and shares with the
// app exactly one thing: the socket, through a bind mount.
//
// The app never receives the real bus socket. Only the proxy mounts it, read-write because a
// bus client must write to connect, and the app's mount is the proxy's own socket.
//
// Everything here is argv-building and therefore pure and testable; the Runtime executes
// what this returns.
