// Package waylandctx is the display adapter: it implements ports.DisplayBroker by giving an
// app a Wayland socket of its own that the compositor has attached a wp_security_context_v1
// to, so what the compositor sees is a named, per-instance identity the app cannot forge
// (docs/architecture.md section 5.2).
//
// The shape is the one section 5.3 and section 5.7 use: the privileged act happens outside
// the app and the app is handed only the result. Zinc connects to the REAL compositor socket,
// binds a second socket of its own, and asks the compositor to accept connections on that
// second socket under a security context. The app mounts the second socket and never the
// compositor's, so its identity is fixed before it exists and there is no request it can send
// to change it. That is the difference from a label: a label describes a container, this
// decides what the display server believes about every connection the container makes.
//
// Two facts in the protocol are what make the design possible:
//
//   - listen_fd must already be bound and listening when create_listener is sent. So the
//     socket is on disk before the app container is created, which it has to be - it is a
//     bind-mount source, and podman cannot mount a path that is not there.
//   - the compositor must keep accepting on listen_fd after the client that created the
//     context disconnects. So the Wayland connection is a one-shot: opened, used, closed. The
//     only thing that must outlive it is the write end of close_fd, and holding a pipe for the
//     app's lifetime is far cheaper than holding a compositor connection.
//
// The manager global is deliberately hidden from clients that already have a security context
// (nesting is a privilege-escalation hole), which is exactly why this has to run outside the
// sandbox: an app could not do it for itself even if it wanted to.
