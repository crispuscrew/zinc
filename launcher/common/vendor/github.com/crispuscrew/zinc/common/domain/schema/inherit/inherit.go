// Package inherit resolves an app config that starts from another one. A config names a
// base in Inherits and states only what differs; what it does not state, it takes from the
// base. Resolution happens every time a config is read, so editing a base changes every app
// built on it - which is the point, and also the thing to be careful with.
//
// The merge is performed on the YAML itself rather than on a decoded AppConfig, and that is
// the whole design. Decoding first would lose the one fact the merge depends on: which keys
// the child actually STATED. Go cannot tell `HostTheme: false` from an absent HostTheme, nor
// an empty Volumes list from an omitted one - both arrive as the zero value. Merging decoded
// structs would therefore have to read every zero value as "inherit", which means a child
// could never turn a base's flag off and never empty a base's list. On a sandboxing tool
// those are not cosmetic gaps: a base setting DisableSecurityContext or granting a
// capability would be impossible to walk back in a child, and the merge would only ever
// loosen. Merging nodes has no such rule, because a stated key is visibly present.
//
// The semantics that fall out are the simple ones:
//
//   - A key the child states wins, whatever its value - including false, and including an
//     empty list.
//   - A key the child omits is taken from the base.
//   - Nested blocks merge key by key, so a child stating one field of StartConditions keeps
//     the base's other fields rather than replacing the block.
//   - A list the child states replaces the base's entirely. Lists are not merged element by
//     element: appending would mean a child could never remove an inherited volume or
//     capability, and capabilities that only ever accumulate down a chain are the wrong
//     direction for this tool.
//
// Resolution is deliberately NOT what gets written back. A child is stored as its author
// wrote it; only the reading side merges. Saving a resolved config would flatten the
// inheritance the first time anyone edited an app in the TUI.
