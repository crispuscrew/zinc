# Zinc - Architecture

> **Priority order: Stable, then Secure, then Beautiful.**
> Keyboard-first, no mouse required. Zinc is a security-focused sandboxing core: it runs
> user-facing apps in rootless Podman containers, each walled off from the rest of the
> desktop, on any Linux distribution (Fedora is the primary development target).

This document is the single source of truth for what Zinc actually ships. Section numbers
are cited from the code (for example "architecture.md 5.3" points at the network model), so
the numbering is kept stable. It targets the **0.1 release**, which ships two tools: `zc`
(the container creator) and `zcr` (the container runner). Everything marked *planned* is on
the roadmap and does not ship yet.

---

## 1. Design Principles

- **Stable first** - declarative config, pinned versions, reproducible from scratch on any
  machine.
- **Secure by default** - minimum host surface; a container gets nothing unless the config
  explicitly grants it. Fail-closed: anything the runtime cannot enforce is rejected, not
  run.
- **Beautiful always** - a consistent visual language, but never at the cost of the two
  priorities above.
- **Keyboard sovereign** - every interaction is reachable without a mouse.
- **No magic** - every decision is explicit, documented, and reversible. A dry run prints
  the exact `podman` commands and firewall rules before anything executes.
- **Honest about limits** - where a security mechanism is partial (see 5.2), the doc says so
  loudly rather than marketing it as more than it is.

---

## 2. Stack Overview

Zinc is the sandboxing core. It is compositor-agnostic and installs cleanly on top of an
existing system; **ZDE** (the Zinc Desktop Environment) is a separate project layered on top
and is out of scope here.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Any Wayland compositor                                     |
|  + wayland-security-context (label applied; enforcement is  |
|    the compositor's, see 5.2)                               |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
|  zc - zinc-creator (CLI + Bubbletea TUI, Go)     |
|    authors app files, forwards run/manage to zcr            |
|                          | shells out over $PATH            |
|  zcr - zinc-container-runner (runtime, Go)                  |
|    reads an app file, runs it, locks the network down       |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
|  Config store (YAML)                                        |
|    ~/.config/zinc/apps/<name>.yaml   (app definitions)      |
|    ~/.config/zinc/zc                (zc's TUI keybinds)   |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
|  Rootless Podman + pasta networking                         |
|    per-app network namespace (a pod), locked by an nftables |
|    ruleset before the app starts (5.3); the ruleset is      |
|    applied by a small digest-pinned netfilter helper image  |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------+
|  Any Linux distribution (Fedora is the primary dev target)  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There is no daemon, no host firewall change, and no persistent background service. `zc` and
`zcr` are two static binaries you put on `$PATH`.

---

## 3. App Config (YAML)

One YAML file per app: `~/.config/zinc/apps/<name>.yaml`. The format is **schema version 2**.
The same file is validated identically at author time (in `zc`, on save) and at launch time
(in `zcr`, before anything runs), because the validation is pure and shared - so a manual
edit or drift cannot slip an invalid config past launch.

`AppConfig` is a flat struct with grouped `*Meta` sub-structs. There are no presets and no
network "modes"; behavior is exactly the fields below.

```yaml
SchemaVersion: 2                 # must be 2 (the only version this build understands)
Type: ZincContainer              # ZincContainer today (ZincVirtualization is planned)

NotificationMeta:                # NOT implemented - a non-default value is refused, not ignored
  Disabled: false
  Silenced: false
  UseCustomPrefix: false
  CustomPrefix: ""
  AllowedActions: false
  AllowedProlonged: false
  AllowedLinks: false

Configs: []                      # bundle-relative config mounts; DEFERRED (not wired yet)
Volumes: []                      # explicit host bind mounts are wired; see below
Keys: []                         # SSH/GPG convenience mounts; see below
HostTheme: true                  # mount the curated host theme bundle read-only (5.6)
AudioMeta:
  Pipewire: false                # pass the Pipewire socket in
  LegacyALSA: false              # mount /dev/snd for ALSA-only apps (rare)
Capabilities: []                 # extra `--cap-add` entries, on top of the drop-all baseline
```

**Volumes.** Each `Volume` is explicit; there is no implicit home access. The runner wires
only **explicit host bind mounts** today (`HostMounted: true` with a `HostMount` path): it
maps `HostMount:InnerMount` with `ro`/`rw` from `Writable` and `noexec`/`exec` from
`Executable`. Anonymous and `SizeLimited` volumes are schema-defined but not wired yet.

A bind mount can also be added for a single run without editing the app file, via a
repeatable `-v`/`--volume` flag on `zcr run`:
`zcr run <app> -v HOST:CONTAINER[:OPTIONS]`, where `OPTIONS` is a comma list (`rw`, `ro`,
`exec`, `noexec`; default `ro,noexec`). Such a mount is appended to the loaded config in
memory - never written back to the YAML - and passes through the same validation and
arg-builder as a configured `Volume`, so it is screened by the same field-shift guards.

```yaml
Volumes:
  - HostMounted: true
    HostMount: /home/user/Downloads
    InnerMount: /home/user/Downloads
    Writable: true
    Executable: false
```

**Keys.** A convenience layer for SSH/GPG only: unlike a plain volume, a `Key` mounts the key
read-only into the container home (`.ssh` for `SSH`, `.gnupg` for `GPG`). Per-key explicit
opt-in.

```yaml
Keys:
  - Type: SSH
    Path: /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**Wired at runtime in 0.1:** identity/image, the network attach and lock-down, the
capability drop-all baseline plus `Capabilities`, Wayland socket + security-context label,
GPU device, the theme bundle, audio (Pipewire socket / `/dev/snd`), explicit host bind
mounts, SSH/GPG key mounts, the entrypoint override, and the terminal / multiterminal /
background / keep-alive lifecycle. `ResourcesMeta` (`--cpus`, `--memory`, `--memory-swap`, `--pids-limit`) and
`InternalUserMeta` (`--user`, `--userns=keep-id`) are enforced now. **Schema-defined
and not wired into the launch:** `NotificationMeta` and `Configs`. `NotificationMeta` is
refused rather than ignored - Zinc has no notification path, so accepting `Silenced` would
tell an author their app is muted while it notifies freely.

### 3.1 Inheritance

`Inherits` names another app in the store this one starts from. The child states only what
differs and takes the rest from its base, which cuts the duplication across a family of
similar apps down to the part that is actually different.

**Resolution is live.** The merge happens every time a config is read, so editing a base
changes every app built on it at the next launch. That is the point of the feature and also
the thing to be careful with: a base that grants a capability grants it to every child, and
the child's own file will not say so. `zc validate <app> --resolved` prints exactly what an
app merges to, which is how an inheriting app is audited.

**The merge is on the YAML, not on the decoded struct**, and that is the whole design. Only
the text records which keys a config actually STATED: once decoded, `HostTheme: false` is
indistinguishable from an absent `HostTheme`, and an empty `Volumes` from an omitted one.
Merging structs would therefore have to read every zero value as "inherit", which means a
child could never turn a base's flag off and never empty a base's list - so a base could
loosen containment in a way no child could walk back. Merging nodes has no such rule.

The rules that fall out:

- A key the child states wins, whatever its value - `false` included, and an empty list
  included.
- A key the child omits comes from the base.
- Nested blocks merge field by field, so a child restating one field of `ResourcesMeta` keeps
  the base's other fields rather than replacing the block.
- A list the child states **replaces** the base's. Lists are not appended: a child could then
  never remove an inherited volume or capability, and capabilities that only ever accumulate
  down a chain are the wrong direction for this tool.
- A cycle, a missing base, or a chain deeper than 8 fails the read. A config that cannot be
  fully resolved is not run, since what it is missing could be the part that contains it.
- `Inherits` is charset-checked before any file is opened - the name is joined into a store
  path, so `../..` would otherwise read a config from outside the apps directory.

**What is stored is always what was written.** Every store exposes both reads: `Load` returns
the file as authored, `LoadResolved` returns what the app is. Launching, validating and
listing use the resolved form; anything that will write the config back uses the raw one.
Saving a resolved config over its source would flatten the inheritance the first time anyone
touched the app.

For the same reason `zc` **refuses to save an app that inherits**: a form knows the app's
values but not which of them it stated, so writing them all back would replace everything the
child inherits with zeros - silently, in a file that looks entirely normal afterwards. An
inheriting app is edited as a file. That is a real limit of combining struct-based editors
with a text-level merge, and refusing is the only version of it that cannot lose an author's
work.

## 4. Tools and the creator / runner split

Every Zinc tool is named `zinc-<kind>-<role>`, where `<kind>` is `container` or
`virtualization` and `<role>` is `runner`, plus a `zinc-launcher-<ui>` picker. One creator
authors both app kinds, so it carries no kind at all. The short code is the initials.

| Short | Tool                          | Role                                   | Status  |
|-------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| `zc`  | `zinc-creator`                | define apps, container or VM           | 0.1     |
| `zcr` | `zinc-container-runner`       | launch + supervise a container app     | 0.1     |
| `zvr` | `zinc-virtualization-runner`  | launch + supervise a VM app            | 0.4     |
| `zlg` | `zinc-launcher-gui`           | fast app launcher (GUI)                | 0.3     |
| `zlt` | `zinc-launcher-tui`           | fast app launcher (TUI)                | 0.2     |

**The split is architectural, not cosmetic.** A *creator* authors an app and writes its
config; a *runner* actually starts that app and owns its lifecycle. `zc` (the creator)
depends only on the shared `common` library and **knows nothing about podman**. To run what
it authors, it shells out to the `zcr` binary on `$PATH`. The two meet only at the on-disk
YAML format and at that process boundary; `zc` never imports `zcr`.

```
   author / manage                        run / supervise
   +-----------------+   shells out to    +------------------+
   |  zc (creator)  |  ---- $PATH ---->  |  zcr (runner)    |
   |  depends: common|   run/build/stop   |  depends: common |
   |  no podman code |   logs/term/image  |  drives podman   |
   +-----------------+                    +------------------+
             \                                   /
              \______ on-disk YAML app file ____/
                 ~/.config/zinc/apps/<name>.yaml
```

`zc` authoring commands (`new`, `list`, `validate`, `delete`, `tui`, `keys`) work without
`zcr`. The runtime commands (`run`, `build`, `stop`, `restart`, `inspect`, `logs`, `term`,
`image`) are forwarded verbatim to `zcr`, streaming its output and preserving its exit
status; if `zcr` is missing, those commands fail with an actionable message while authoring
keeps working. Details in section 9.

---

## 5. Security Model - what each layer actually gives you

### 5.1 Container isolation (rootless Podman)

**Strong. This is the real security boundary.** Namespaces isolate PID, network, mounts,
IPC, and UTS. The user namespace maps container root to your unprivileged host user, so
"root in the container" is not root on the host. An app cannot see the host filesystem
outside its explicit mounts, cannot see other containers, and cannot escalate.

Every app container starts from a least-privilege baseline: `--security-opt
no-new-privileges --cap-drop all`. Anything the app genuinely needs is re-added explicitly
from `Capabilities`, and each capability is validated against a safe charset. The launch is
hermetic - `--pull never` - so a run never triggers a surprise registry pull; the image must
already be in local storage (resolved at author time or built as a derived image).

### 5.2 Wayland isolation (wayland-security-context)

**Partial in practice - be honest.** The `wp_security_context_v1` protocol lets the
compositor tag a client so it can be treated as untrusted. Zinc applies the marker: when
`DisplayMeta.DisableSecurityContext` is false (the default), the app container is labelled
`zinc.wayland=security-context` and the Wayland socket is passed in read-only.

But enforcement is the compositor's and the toolkit's job, not Zinc's. An app that ignores
the protocol still talks to the compositor. Treat the security-context label as a hint that
improves as compositors and toolkits adopt it, not as a wall. **The real isolation boundary
for a container is the container itself** (5.1). For genuinely untrusted GUI apps the future
answer is a VM (section 10), not a nested compositor.

### 5.3 Network isolation (per-app netns, fail-closed)

**Strong, and the crown jewel of the security model.** An app's `NetworkMeta.NetworkLists`
drive a fail-closed firewall applied in the app's **own network namespace before the app
process starts**. There is never an unfiltered window.

Mechanics:

- A filtered app (one with any `NetworkLists`) runs inside a **pod**. The pod's infra
  container owns the network namespace and provides connectivity via **pasta** (userspace,
  no host root, no host firewall change).
- Before the app container joins the pod, an **nftables ruleset is loaded into the pod's
  netns** by a one-shot init step: `podman run --pod <pod> --pull never --cap-drop all
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --security-opt no-new-privileges <netfilter-image> nft -f -`, with the
  ruleset piped in on stdin. `CAP_NET_ADMIN` is namespaced to the pod's user namespace, so it
  grants nothing on the host.
- Only then is the app container started with `--pod <pod>`. The lock is in place first, so
  the app never sees an open network.
- An app with **no** `NetworkLists` gets `--network none`: it reaches only its own localhost,
  fully isolated.
- The whole thing is fail-closed. If any prepare step fails, the half-built pod is torn down.
  If the app dies after fork, a reaping goroutine tears the pod (and its netns) down too, so
  no rule-less netns is ever left behind.

Enforcement is a **port** in the runner hexagon (`NetEnforcer`, see section 13): the
pasta-plus-nft implementation is one adapter. Swapping the traffic-control mechanism later (a
different firewall, an eBPF egress filter, an external controller) is a new adapter, with the
launch path unchanged. The tiers and the exact ruleset are in section 6.

### 5.4 GPU passthrough

**Weak isolation when enabled.** Granting `/dev/dri` (via `DisplayMeta.DisableGpuAccess:
false`) exposes GPU rendering state more broadly than process boundaries suggest, and Linux
GPU sandboxing is immature. GPU access is **off by default**. Rule: never enable it for
untrusted code.

### 5.5 Image trust (digest pinning + derived images)

**Pin by digest, not by tag, for third-party images.** Validation enforces this: an
`ImageMeta.Image` that is not a `localhost/` reference must be a canonical digest pin
(`...@sha256:` followed by exactly 64 hex characters). Only `localhost/` images - which
resolve to local storage and can never pull something remote - may use a mutable tag. The
image reference must also be a single clean line (no whitespace or control characters),
because it is interpolated into a `FROM` line and into podman arguments.

To make pinning painless without a browser, `zc image search <term>` and `zc image resolve
<ref>` (forwarded to `zcr`) find an image and print its digest-pinned form to paste into
`ImageMeta.Image`; the TUI resolves the image field in place.

**Derived images** are the "quick setup" path and are covered in section 7. Their base
inherits the digest-pin rule above, so a derived build always starts from a known base.

### 5.6 Theme passthrough

**Default on, security impact minimal.** When `HostTheme` is true and a theme bundle is
available, the runner mounts a single curated directory read-only at `/etc/zinc/theme` inside
the container - not the host's real `~/.config` or `~/.themes`. The bundle path comes from
`ZINC_THEME_BUNDLE`; generating that bundle (GTK/Qt configs, icon and cursor themes, fonts)
is a job for the desktop layer (ZDE), out of scope for Zinc 0.1. The point of default-on is
that containerized apps look like part of the system; set `HostTheme: false` to deny it.

---

## 6. Networking model and startup ordering

This section expands 5.3: the scopes, the four tiers, the exact ruleset, and, at the end, how
dependent apps are started.

### 6.1 Scopes and direction

Each `NetworkList` entry is one directional rule. The fields that shape it:

- **`Host`** - scope. `false` (default) means the app's own netns. `true` means the host: a
  host-interface bind for LAN publishing (ingress), or host-scoped egress (not supported yet,
  6.5).
- **`AppName`** - for `Host: false`, which app's network. `""` (default) means this app
  itself; a name means a sibling app (a link, tier 2).
- **`Ingress`** - direction. `false` (default) is an **egress** rule: `Ports` are destination
  ports the app may reach. `true` is an **ingress** rule: `Ports` are the app's own listening
  ports, exposed to the scope.
- **`Blacklist`** - `false` (default) is a whitelist (default-drop; allow only what is
  listed). `true` is allow-all-except (default-accept with the listed entries dropped).
- **`IPv4CIDR` / `IPv6CIDR`** - destinations (egress) or allowed sources (ingress). The two
  families are emitted separately, so a v4 CIDR never gates v6 traffic.
- **`Domains`** - destinations named rather than numbered (egress only). Resolved AT LAUNCH
  into addresses on this list, under the same `Ports`. A snapshot, not name filtering, and not
  refreshed while the app runs - see 6.2.
- **`Ports`** - TCP+UDP port set for the rule. Not honoured on a `Via` list (the link is
  accepted whole), which is refused rather than accepted.
- **`Interface`** - a specific host/app interface to bind (pasta copies its addressing).
  Refused on an app that also has a sibling link: such an app is on bridges rather than pasta,
  where podman publishes by address and the interface could not be honoured.
- **`Via`** - on an egress list naming an `AppName`, send this list's CIDRs THROUGH that
  sibling instead of out this app's own egress (6.2). One list carries one address family.
- **`Forward`** - on a producer's own ingress list, agree to route for the siblings on its
  link. Never implied by another app naming it.
- **`ForwardPorts`** - what a forwarding app will carry, by destination port. Empty carries
  any port. The addresses are not repeated here: the client already fixed them by choosing
  what to route (6.2).
- **`GatewayV4` / `GatewayV6`** - next-hop for multi-homing (not supported yet, 6.5).

`NetworkMeta` also carries **`DNSServers`**: the resolvers the app is handed, and - once it
has any `NetworkLists` - the only ones its ruleset lets it reach. Required for a routed app,
whose first resolver must be IPv4 (6.2).

List order is priority: the first entry wins. Blocking DNS, for example, is just an egress
blacklist for ports 53 and 853, ordered ahead of any broad allow so it wins. Validation
rejects an **egress port rule with no destination CIDRs** (it would silently no-op and leave
those ports open); name `0.0.0.0/0` and/or `::/0` for "everywhere", or drop the ports. An
ingress list needs no CIDR - empty means "any source".

### 6.2 The four tiers

| Tier | Config shape | Result |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Isolated | no `NetworkLists` | `--network none`; the app reaches only its own localhost |
| Egress   | egress list(s), self-scoped | default-drop; allow only the listed destination CIDRs and ports |
| LAN publish (tier 3) | `Ingress: true` + `Host: true` | publish the app's own ports to the LAN via pod `-p` forwards, filtered by source address |
| Sibling link (tier 2) | egress list naming another app's `AppName` | a private `--internal` bridge between the two apps, gated per-port |

**Sibling link, in detail.** A consumer's egress list that names a producer's `AppNameID`,
and the producer's own self-scoped ingress list, attach both apps to a private, internal
bridge `zinc-link-<producer>` with fixed interface names (`zlink0`, `zlink1`, ...) and a
network alias equal to each app's `AppNameID` (so a consumer connects to `<producer>:<port>`).
The producer accepts only its published `Ports` inbound on that link interface; everything
else default-drops. The consumer accepts nothing new inbound. The bridge is `--internal`, so
neither app reaches anything else through it.

**Allowing a destination by name.** An egress list may carry `Domains` alongside its CIDRs.
Each name is resolved **at launch** and its addresses join that list's allowed set, under the
same `Ports` - so the renderer only ever sees addresses and the ruleset is ordinary nft.

Read the guarantee precisely, because it is narrower than "this app may only talk to these
domains":

- What is enforced is at the IP layer, on the addresses those names held when the app
  started. An app that resolves somewhere else and connects is dropped. An app that connects
  to one of those addresses **by number**, without asking DNS, is allowed. Nothing inspects a
  hostname on the wire, and nothing here would notice one.
- Addresses shared by other names are shared by this rule. A domain on shared hosting or
  behind a large CDN allows every other name on the same address.
- **The snapshot is not refreshed while the app runs.** A domain whose addresses rotate will
  drift out of the set and the app loses access to it until it is restarted. That direction
  is deliberate: a stale entry stops working rather than quietly allowing whoever holds the
  address now. Making it live needs a resident process in the netns updating an nft set from
  DNS answers, which is a different design and is not what this is.
- A name that does not resolve **fails the launch**, naming the domain. An app that starts,
  looks healthy, and cannot reach the one host it exists to talk to - with the reason visible
  nowhere - is the worse outcome.

Refused rather than accepted-and-mis-enforced: `Domains` on an ingress list (an incoming
packet carries an address, not a name, so resolving would admit whoever holds that address),
on a blacklist (blocking a name would mean blocking every address it is *not* resolved to,
and the rule would read as a ban while stopping only today's addresses), and on a sibling
link (gated by interface, so an address set on it enforces nothing).

**DNS for a routed app.** `NetworkMeta.DNSServers`, required once a list sets `Via`. podman
writes a container's `resolv.conf` and points it at the network's own resolver; on an
`--internal` bridge that resolver answers sibling names and forwards nothing, so a routed app
gets NXDOMAIN for anything external. Zinc therefore does two things: it hands the pod the
declared resolvers (`--dns`), and - because the app may still hold a resolver of its own, and
because what matters is where the query GOES rather than what `resolv.conf` says - it
redirects the query in the app's netns: DNS to any
address is rewritten (`nat` `output`, `dstnat` priority, so the filter hook then sees the new
address) to the declared resolver, which is routed through the sibling like anything else - it
travels inside the tunnel and stops with it. Whatever is not redirected is dropped. Only a
routed app is redirected: for an ordinary one the network's resolver works and is the only
thing that knows its siblings' names.

**Routing through a sibling.** An egress list that names an `AppName` and sets `Via: true`
sends its CIDRs to that sibling over their private link instead of out this app's own egress -
how an app is put behind a VPN container. It is per list, so one app can pick a different
backend per destination. The client gets no other path to those destinations, so it cannot
leak past the sibling, and when the sibling stops its traffic blackholes rather than falling
back (measured, both ways).

The sibling must agree: `Forward: true` on its own link ingress list. Forwarding for other
apps makes an app a router, so it is never implied by another app naming it. A forwarding app
gets `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` at pod creation - a container cannot set it itself, `/proc/sys`
is read-only in the namespace - plus a default-drop `forward` chain and `masquerade`, without
which replies would be addressed to a private link address the outside cannot route back to.

**What a gateway carries is bounded from both ends, and the two ends belong to different
apps.** *Where* is the client's: only the CIDRs its own `Via` list names are routed to the
gateway at all, and the client cannot change that - the runner installs those routes and the
app has no capability to alter them. *What* is the gateway's, and it is `ForwardPorts`. A
gateway that sets `ForwardPorts: [53]` is a DNS hop: whatever a client points at it, only
port 53 crosses. Empty carries any port, which is what a general-purpose gateway is for.

A gateway's **own** egress rules deliberately do not bound what it forwards. They say where
*this app* may go; forwarded traffic is somebody else's, and was already bounded by whoever
sent it. The `forward` hook is a separate chain from `output`, so the two never see each
other's rules - that is a design line, not an oversight.

**Gateways chain.** The forward chain accepts out of every interface the gateway's own routes
can use - its egress bridge, and any link it is itself routed through - with `masquerade`
following onto each. So a hop can pass its clients' traffic onward into another gateway
rather than out to the network, and a relay whose every list is a link has no egress bridge
at all.

The gateway's address is never written into a config. podman assigns it and it changes when
the gateway is recreated, so the route step resolves it at launch through the network alias
podman already gives every app on a link. It runs before the ruleset, because resolving needs
DNS and the ruleset closes the netns - and both run before the app, so the app still never
sees an unlocked network.

A gateway is worth a `StartConditions.ReadyCheck` (6.6): a routed client whose gateway is up
but whose tunnel is not has nowhere to send anything, and the readiness gate is what makes
`DependsOn` wait for the tunnel rather than for the container.

**A linked app may also reach the outside.** One app is gated both ways at once: the `zlink*`
bridges by interface, everything else by address and port. Chain policy comes from the
non-link lists alone - a link list is structurally a whitelist, so counting it would flip an
app that pairs a link with an all-blacklist egress to default-drop and silently deny what the
blacklist meant to leave open. Such an app cannot use pasta: podman refuses more than one
network unless it is in bridge mode, so it gets `zinc-egress-<app>` instead, a routable bridge
of **its own**. Not the shared default bridge - apps on one bridge can reach each other over
L2, which would leave isolation resting on the nft rules, and an app whose egress list is an
all-blacklist runs default-accept. A link-only app is unchanged and stays on its private
bridges alone.

### 6.3 The nftables ruleset

The ruleset is a pure function of the validated config, rendered as `table inet zinc`. A
standard (egress and/or tier-3) app builds an `output` chain (egress: `daddr`/`dport`) and,
when it publishes, an `input` chain (ingress: `saddr`/`dport`). A tier-2 (sibling-link) app
is gated by interface as well: the private `zlink*` bridges are accepted, a producer's
published ports are accepted inbound on its own link interface, and any address rules the same
app carries are still emitted alongside. (Both kinds are rendered at once; before 0.7 it was
one or the other, and whichever ran ignored the other kind of list outright.) An app with any
link always gets an input chain, published or not - it shares that bridge with its siblings,
and a hook with no base chain is not filtered at all.

Every chain defaults to `policy drop` and always accepts loopback and
`established,related` traffic (so a server's reply rides the established rule). Per-direction
policy follows that direction's lists: a whitelist present means default-drop (fail-closed);
an all-blacklist direction means default-accept with the listed drops as high-priority
carve-outs. A direction with no lists stays default-drop - a pure publisher gets no egress; an
egress-only app gets no input chain at all.

A dry run (`zcr run <app>` with no `--exec`) prints the exact `podman` commands **and the nft
ruleset that would be piped in**, so what will be enforced is fully visible before anything
runs.

### 6.4 The netfilter helper image

The nft step runs inside a tiny helper image, `zinc/netfilter:local`, built once with `make
netfilter-image` (in `container/runner`). It is a digest-pinned Alpine base with a
version-pinned `nftables`. It is referenced by a local tag and run with `--pull never`, so the
privileged step is always the locally vetted build and never a registry pull; a missing image
fails fast with a clear error. It runs with `--cap-drop all --cap-add NET_ADMIN
--security-opt no-new-privileges`, reads the ruleset on stdin, and exits - the rules persist
in the pod's netns for the app that starts next.

### 6.5 Not supported yet (rejected, not run)

The runtime is fail-closed: a config it cannot enforce correctly is **rejected at launch**,
never silently mis-enforced. Rejected in this build:

- **Host-scoped egress** (`Host: true` with an egress list).
- **Gateway / multi-homing** (`GatewayV4` or `GatewayV6` set) - the fields are schema-legal,
  but a config using them is rejected.
- **An ingress list that targets an `AppName`** - contradictory (a producer publishes to any
  sibling that joins its link; the consumer names the producer).

Also deferred at the mount layer: bundle-relative `Configs` mounts and anonymous/size-limited
volumes; only explicit host bind mounts are wired (section 3).

### 6.6 Dependency startup ordering

`StartConditions.DependsOn` lists apps that must be up before this one. On launch the runner
brings them up first, depth-first, so a dependency's own dependencies come up before it. An
already-running dependency is left untouched; a dependency cycle is reported as an error
rather than recursed into forever. This is why launch is a single orchestrated path (the app
layer, section 13) rather than a bare `podman run`.

**Running is not ready.** By default a dependency counts as up once its container is, which is
true enough for a service whose process is its readiness and false for anything a dependent
routes through: a VPN container is running long before its tunnel is, and a client started in
that window has a default route and a resolver pointing at a gateway that cannot forward yet
(6.2, routing). `StartConditions.ReadyCheck` closes that window. It is a command in exec form
(`["sh", "-c", "ip link show wg0 | grep -q UP"]`) which the runner quotes word by word and
installs as the container's healthcheck, so `podman ps` reports health for the same question
the launch sequence waits on, and which a dependent polls until it passes or `ReadyTimeoutSec`
(default 60s) runs out. It is installed in the `CMD-SHELL` form rather than the tidier JSON
exec form, which podman 5 understands and podman 4.9 - what Ubuntu LTS ships - does not; a
launch-blocking gate has to work on the podman people actually have, so the image needs a
shell.

A dependency that never becomes ready fails the dependent's launch rather than letting it
start anyway: for the routed case, starting is not degraded operation, it is an app whose
every connection fails for a reason nothing reported. Only a dependency this launch started is
waited on - one that was already running was gated the same way by whoever started it.

---

## 7. Images: derived builds and base images

**Third-party images are pulled and pinned by digest** (5.5). **Derived images** are the
quick-setup path: instead of authoring a Containerfile, an app sets `ImageMeta.Install` to one
or more shell lines, and Zinc builds a small image `FROM <ImageMeta.Image>` plus a single
`RUN` layer carrying those lines (joined with `&&`, so a multi-step setup fails fast). The
app then runs that derived image instead of the bare base.

- The derived image is tagged locally, `zinc/app-<name>:local`, built with `-t`, run with
  `--pull never`, and never pushed.
- Its `FROM` base is `ImageMeta.Image`, which 5.5 forces to be digest-pinned (or a
  `localhost/` ref), so the build starts from a known base. Because a per-machine local build
  has no meaningful registry digest, the derived image is not itself digest-pinned; its
  guarantee is the pinned base plus the visible install lines.
- Freshness is tracked by an OCI label, `zinc.build`, holding a fingerprint of the inputs
  (the base image plus the install script). A plain `zcr run` rebuilds automatically when the
  image is missing or the fingerprint differs, so an unchanged app reuses its image and a
  re-pinned base or edited install takes effect on the next run. `zcr build <app>` (or `zc
  build`, or the TUI build action) forces a rebuild.
- The install line runs through the image's own `/bin/sh`, so a distro package-manager
  invocation works exactly as typed. The form offers a per-distro hint (apt for
  debian/ubuntu, apk for alpine, dnf for fedora/rhel, pacman for arch, zypper for openSUSE),
  derived from the base image name; it is UI sugar only and never constrains what may go into
  `Install`.

The example `hollywood.yaml` app is a derived-image demo: a stock digest-pinned Debian base
plus `apt-get install -y hollywood`, run in a terminal window.

Locally built base images (for example a language toolchain image to layer projects on) are
referenced by a `localhost/` tag and are exempt from the digest pin; trust comes from the
vetted, version-pinned recipe rather than a global digest, and their own `FROM` base is still
digest-pinned. Shipping a curated set of such base images is on the roadmap.

---

## 8. Build and Release

**Podman-only. There is no host Go for tool builds.** Every Go command - `test`, `vet`,
`fmt`, `vendor`, `build` - runs inside a **digest-pinned `golang` container**, invoked
through `make`. There is no `go run`: `make build` produces a static binary in the container
and you run that binary.

The build logic is shared, not copied. A single repo-root `Containerfile` (the pinned Go
toolchain; it builds whichever module is the build context), a `check.mk` of containerized
checks that every module includes, and a `tool.mk` of binary targets that each tool's
three-line `Makefile` includes. "The same logic, only different paths."

From any module (`common`, `container/runner`, `creator`):

```sh
make check      # gofmt + go vet + go test, in the pinned container
make build      # reproducible build -> ./bin/<tool>
make repro      # build twice, assert the binary is byte-identical
make vendor     # refresh vendored deps (the only step that needs network; GOWORK=off)
```

Reproducibility is enforced by pinning every input: the Go toolchain by digest
(`GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, so it never silently downloads a different one), dependencies by each
module's `./vendor` plus `go.sum` (built with `-mod=vendor`, no proxy, no network), and the
build flags themselves (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, `-trimpath`, `-buildvcs=false`, `-ldflags="-s -w
-buildid="`). Same inputs, same bytes, on any machine.

**Versioning.** Each binary carries a `version`, stamped from `git describe` via
`-ldflags "-X main.version=..."`; `zc version` and `zcr version` print it. A plain build with
no git falls back to `dev`.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs three jobs: `common` (gofmt / vet / test on the
schema and validation), `check` (a matrix of `container/runner` and `creator`, each
running `make check` and `make build`), and `e2e` (the end-to-end suite driving the real
binaries against podman).

Every module in the tree is built and checked in CI. There is no separate VM creator: `zc`
authors both app types, so the old `virtualization/creator/` skeleton was deleted in 0.4
rather than migrated.

---

## 9. Components

### 9.1 zc - the creator

**Stack:** Go + Bubbletea. `zc` authors app files and manages them; it depends only on the
shared `common` library and never imports the runtime.

Authoring commands (local, no runtime needed):

```
zc new <name> --image <img> [--desc d] [--icon i]
zc list
zc validate <name|app.yaml> [--resolved]
zc delete <name>
zc keys list|show|set <s>|edit|validate|path
zc compose export <name> [-o f]     zc compose import <compose.yaml> [--service s] [--dry-run]
zc tui
```

Runtime commands (forwarded verbatim to `zcr`, see 9.2):

```
zc run <name|app.yaml> [--exec]     zc build <name|app.yaml>
zc stop|restart|inspect <name>      zc logs <name> [-f]
zc term <name> [--shell]            zc image search <term>|resolve <ref>
```

A bare `<name>` resolves against the store (`~/.config/zinc/apps`); an argument that looks
like a path (contains `/` or ends in `.yaml`) is read directly.

**The TUI** is the keyboard-first manager: create, edit, run, stop, logs, delete, rename. Its
form footers show only the gestures that actually apply to the focused field and the app's
current state, drawn from the active scheme, so the hints stay honest instead of a fixed wall
of keys. An **advanced** row opens the full YAML in `$EDITOR`, where capabilities, network
lists, volumes, and keys are edited directly. The TUI's run/stop/build/term/logs actions all
go through `zcr` (via the backend facade); `zc` never runs a container itself.

**Keybind schemes.** `zc`'s own TUI keys are not hardcoded: they resolve through a
selectable scheme. Two are built in (`default` and `vim`) and users can define their own under
`~/.config/zinc/zc`. `zc keys list|show|set|edit|validate|path` and an in-TUI picker (open
with `?`) choose and apply one, switching live. These are `zc`'s interface keys only, an
implementation detail of the creator; they are distinct from any desktop hotkeys, which are a
host-level (ZDE) concern. (The scheme files happen to be TOML internally; that is a `zc`
implementation detail and has nothing to do with the app format, which is YAML.)

**Compose interop** (`internal/compose`) translates between an app definition and a
Compose-specification file, in both directions. Both are authoring, which is why they live
here and not in the runner, and neither is lossless - so both print what did not cross rather
than omitting it silently.

*Exporting drops guarantees.* A compose file cannot express the nftables egress lock-down
applied to the app's netns before it starts, the Wayland security context, or the desktop
wiring the runner resolves from the live session. What it can carry - image, entrypoint, user,
capabilities, resource limits, mounts, published ports, `depends_on`, and the `ReadyCheck` as a
`healthcheck` - it carries, and the generated file leads with a comment saying it describes an
app rather than sandboxing one. A VM app is refused outright: a guest is not a container.

*Importing tightens.* Compose has no way to say what a service may reach, so reading its
silence as "full network access" would import a posture nobody chose. An imported app arrives
with no NetworkLists, which is no network at all; published ports are the one exception,
because they are stated. Everything else fails closed the same way: an unqualified mount
becomes read-only and noexec (compose's default is read-write), `cap_add: ALL` is refused, a
bare numeric `user` is dropped because Zinc passes the user to podman by name, and a mutable
image tag is resolved to its digest through `zcr image resolve` before the app is saved -
without which validation would reject it anyway. Each service becomes its own app, and
`depends_on` becomes `DependsOn` (with the caveat, printed, that ordering is not connectivity:
in compose the two share a network, in Zinc a link has to be declared).

Internally `zc` is a small CLI over a backend facade: an `internal/store` YAML app store (a
mirror of the same on-disk format `zcr` reads), an `internal/runner` delegate that finds `zcr`
on `$PATH` and drives it, an `internal/backend` facade the CLI and TUI both call, the
`internal/tui` Bubbletea UI, `internal/compose` for the interop above, and `internal/keys` for
the keybind schemes.

### 9.2 zcr - the runner

**Stack:** Go. `zcr` is the runtime. It reads an app file and runs it as a rootless podman
container, applying the network lock-down before the app starts (5.3). `zc` shells out to it,
but it is a first-class CLI you can drive directly:

```
zcr run <app> [--exec]      print the launch plan, or launch it (--exec)
zcr build <app>             (re)build the derived image (ImageMeta.Install)
zcr validate <app>          parse + validate; report problems and warnings
zcr stop|restart|inspect <app>
zcr logs <app> [-f]         zcr term <app> [--shell]      zcr ps
zcr image search <term> | resolve <ref>
```

Without `--exec`, `run` is a dry run: it validates and prints the exact `podman` command(s)
and any nft ruleset that would be enforced. This is the "no magic" principle in action.

The launch path is a single orchestrated sequence (validate -> gate unsupported network
shapes -> auto-start dependencies -> build the derived image if needed -> run the network
lock-down through the `NetEnforcer` -> start the app container detached), so there is exactly
one path to get right.

**Terminal apps.** A GUI app renders through the passed-in Wayland socket. A CLI/TUI app
(`StartConditions.Terminal`) is launched inside the host's terminal emulator with an
interactive TTY - a container otherwise has no terminal to attach to. The emulator argv comes
from `ZINC_TERMINAL` (else `$TERMINAL`), so both `foot` and `xterm -e` forms work; launching a
terminal app with neither set fails with a clear message. See section 11.

**Multiterminal apps.** A terminal app may also set `StartConditions.Multiterminal` to attach
many terminals to one shared instance. The container runs a detached **holder** (`sleep
infinity` under `--init`, so `podman stop` is prompt), and every terminal is a `podman exec
-it` into it, running the app's own command (or a shell with `--shell`). The app lives until
the **last terminal closes**, unless `StopConditions.Background` keeps the holder running.
Coordination is by filesystem flock under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zinc/run/<app>/`, with no daemon
and no socket: a per-app lock serializes holder start-up, each terminal's waiter flock-holds a
liveness marker for its life (auto-released on death, so a killed terminal cannot wedge the
count), and the last waiter out stops the container. Because a holder owns PID 1, a
multiterminal app needs an explicit entrypoint (the image default cannot be replayed into each
terminal), which validation enforces.

### 9.3 zlt - the launcher (TUI)

**Stack:** Go + Bubbletea. `zlt` (zinc-launcher-tui) is a fast, keyboard-first fuzzy
picker over the defined apps. It lists `~/.config/zinc/apps`, filters as you type (a small
in-house subsequence matcher that favours matches at the start of a name and at word
boundaries), and on **enter launches the selected app by shelling out to `zcr run <app>
--exec`**, then quits (dmenu-style). So `zcr` still does the real work - validation,
dependency auto-start, the derived-image build, the network lock-down - and `zlt`, like
`zc`, depends only on `common` and never imports the runtime. A `zlt <app>` form launches
one app directly (for a desktop hotkey or a script), and a `●` marks apps already running
(best-effort, from `zcr ps`). It lives at `launcher/tui`; the read / launch / match logic it
shares with `zlg` lives in the `launcher/common` library.

### 9.4 zlg - the launcher (GUI)

**Stack:** Go, rendering in pure Go with no cgo. `zlg` (zinc-launcher-gui) is the graphical
sibling of `zlt`: the same quick picker over the defined apps, for a point-and-click or
keyboard launch. The picker window itself is the reusable **`menu` module** (below); `zlg` is
a thin consumer of it - it loads the defined apps, marks the ones `zcr` reports running, and
hands `menu.Run` an activate closure that launches the chosen app through `zcr`. So, like
`zlt`, it takes the read / launch / match logic from `launcher/common`, shells out to `zcr`,
and never imports the runtime. `zlg <app>` launches one app directly.

Because it builds on `menu`, `zlg` is a **static, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, runs-anywhere,
byte-reproducible** binary built from the same minimal image as the other tools (no graphics
libraries, no dynamic linking), and it is a real **`wlr-layer-shell` floating overlay** - a
centered, keyboard-grabbing panel that floats above the tiled windows, the way fuzzel/wofi
do, not a tiled window. Known limit (0.3): the keymap is US-QWERTY (full xkb layout support
is future work).

**The `menu` module** (repo-root `menu/`, module path `github.com/crispuscrew/zinc/menu`) is
the overlay-menu core, extracted out of `zlg` so any program can build its own menus over it.
It speaks the Wayland wire protocol directly (go-wayland) plus a **hand-written
`wlr-layer-shell` binding** (`menu/layershell.go`, since go-wayland ships only core +
xdg-shell), software-renders a fuzzy-filtered list into a shared-memory buffer with a bundled
bitmap font, and reads the system light/dark palette from the XDG desktop portal over D-Bus.
Everything but the Wayland event loop is a pure, unit-tested package (`internal/picker`,
`internal/keymap`, `internal/render`, `internal/theme`, and the `internal/match` fuzzy
matcher). Its whole public API is one call, `menu.Run(items, activate, opts)`. It
deliberately depends on **no** Zinc sibling module (Go `replace` directives are not
transitive, so a sibling dependency would make it un-importable from another repo), so `zde`
and a future wofi-like picker can import it too.

### 9.5 zvr - the VM runner

`zvr` (section 10) is the virtualization sibling of `zcr`, sharing the same `common` schema
library so every tool uses one config format. It depends only on `common` and drives
`qemu-system-x86_64` directly.

---

## 10. Virtualization (zvr)

For isolation beyond what containers provide - untrusted GUI apps, foreign OSes, throwaway
environments - Zinc runs VM apps alongside container apps. Containers remain the primary
runtime; VMs are the heavy-isolation escape hatch. Both kinds are authored by `zc` into the
same store and split by `Type`, and each runner refuses the other's apps by name rather than
half-running them.

### 10.1 Why qemu directly, and not libvirt

Earlier drafts of this document specified libvirt. The implementation does not use it, and
the reason is worth recording because it is not a matter of taste.

libvirtd spawns the qemu process, so that process is not in the user's session and cannot
open a window on their compositor. libvirt's answer is SPICE plus a separate viewer, which
adds a hop between the guest's frames and the screen. For a VM that exists to run something
interactive - a game, anything real-time - that hop is the whole problem.

Driving qemu directly means `zvr` starts it as a child of the user's session, so the guest
gets a local, GPU-accelerated window whose frames never leave the machine. It also matches
the container side exactly: build an argv from validated config, exec a binary, print the
command with `--dry-run`.

The cost is real and is paid deliberately: **`zvr` owns supervision.** Starting, finding and
stopping guests is its job, where libvirt would have provided it, along with snapshots and
managed save, which `zvr` does not have.

### 10.2 How a guest runs

A launch is: validate the config, verify the base image against its pinned digest, create
the app's overlay if it has none, rebuild its cloud-init seed, compose the argv, start the
process. Nothing is created for a config that does not validate, and no guest starts from a
base image that no longer matches its digest.

**Disks are copy-on-write.** The base image named by `ImageMeta.Image` is never opened for
writing; each app gets its own qcow2 overlay backed by it, so `zvr reset` deletes the overlay
and the app is back to its authored image. That is the VM reading of a container's
disposability.

**The base is pinned by `VirtualizationMeta.BaseDigest`**, the sha256 of the file's bytes. A
container digest rides inside its reference; a file's cannot, so the pin is its own field -
but the rule is the one from section 5.5: what runs is what was authorised. The image is
hashed in full on first use and then whenever its identity moves (device, inode, size, and
both timestamps at nanosecond resolution). That catches a base that was replaced, rebuilt or
restored. It is not a defence against someone who can already write to the image directory,
because they can rewrite the cache alongside it.

**Supervision is a pidfile plus QMP.** The same control socket carries the ACPI power button,
so a graceful stop lets the guest's own OS flush and unmount rather than being killed
mid-write; SIGTERM and then SIGKILL stand behind it. A pidfile is checked against `/proc`
before anything is signalled, because pids are recycled.

**The guest's hardware is exactly what the config asked for.** qemu is started with
`-nodefaults`, so nothing arrives merely because it was compiled in, and the host process is
confined by qemu's own seccomp jail (`-sandbox on`, denying privilege elevation, helper
spawning and scheduling changes).

### 10.3 Display and the boundaries that do not carry over

`VirtualizationMeta.Display` is explicit, never inferred: `Accelerated` attaches
`virtio-gpu-gl` and a local window, so guest 3D runs on the host GPU and reaches the
compositor as a dmabuf; `Window` is the same without acceleration; `None` is headless with a
serial console; `Compatible` is an unaccelerated framebuffer for a guest that has no
virtio-gpu driver at all. Accelerated 3D needs a guest with that driver, which in practice
means Linux.

Two container mechanisms deliberately do **not** carry over, and are rejected rather than
approximated:

- **The egress lock-down.** It is nftables applied inside a container's own network
  namespace; a guest has its own kernel and none of that reaches it. A VM app uses user-mode
  networking with explicit `ForwardPorts`, each bound to 127.0.0.1 so a guest service reaches
  the host that started it and not the LAN. `NetworkMeta` on a VM app is a validation error.
- **Host mounts, keys, capabilities and the theme bundle.** All of these are bind mounts or
  kernel features of a shared kernel. Sharing a directory into a guest needs virtiofs, which
  this build does not implement, so those fields are refused on a VM app with a message
  saying what supporting them would take.

A field that looks configured while doing nothing is worse than one that refuses to save,
because the author believes in a boundary that is not there. This is the same principle as
the network model rejecting what it cannot enforce.

### 10.4 A Windows-class guest

Windows is not Linux with a flag flipped. It needs a different machine, and the fields that
describe it are separate and explicit rather than a "Windows" preset, so the config says what
the machine has and the guest either drives it or does not.

**Devices the guest has drivers for.** `Devices: Compatible` gives an AHCI disk, an Intel
e1000e NIC and a USB tablet. Windows Setup ships drivers for none of the virtio hardware, and
pointed at a virtio disk it reports finding no drives at all, so this is a property of the
machine rather than a performance preference.

**Firmware, and a failure that is nearly invisible.** Windows 11 requires UEFI, Secure Boot
and a TPM 2.0. Secure Boot needs SMM: the firmware keeps its signature database in memory only
System Management Mode may write, and without it OVMF runs but does not enforce anything, so
the guest reports Secure Boot switched off. The TPM is swtpm over its **control** socket, not
its data socket; pointed at the wrong one qemu blocks forever before it opens a window.

The sharpest edge is which OVMF build is used. Distributions ship two generations side by
side, and only the current 4 MB build carries the TPM driver. QEMU publishes the TPM's ACPI
device itself, so on the legacy 2 MB build a guest still enumerates it and still binds a
driver to it. Only Windows notices there is nothing behind it, and all it says is that the PC
does not meet its requirements. Zinc prefers builds that hand the TPM over, warns when only a
legacy one exists, and refuses a variable store written by the other generation rather than
letting qemu boot a quietly wrong Secure Boot state.

**A machine identity of its own.** Left alone, every qemu guest reports the SMBIOS UUID
`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` and the MAC `52:54:00:12:34:56`. Windows Autopilot
identifies a device by a hash over those fields, so a guest with the defaults can match a
stranger's corporate enrolment and reach OOBE demanding a sign-in to their tenant. Both are
derived from the app name: unique per app, and stable, because Windows treats a changed UUID
as swapped hardware and asks to be reactivated. `MacAddress` overrides the NIC's address for a
guest that should not announce itself as a QEMU machine at all.

**A screen size fixed at boot.** A guest with no display driver takes the mode the firmware
gave it and cannot be told about another, so the resolution is chosen once and resizing the
window only scales those pixels. Plain VGA cannot be given one, which is why an unconfigured
guest is always 1280x800. `DisplayWidth`/`DisplayHeight` switch it to a display the firmware
does take a size from, along with a framebuffer sized to the screen and an EDID refresh rate
low enough that the mode's pixel clock fits its own field. Every one of those limits fails the
same silent way, by coming up at 1280x800 with nothing logged, so a size that cannot work is
refused at validation instead. What validation cannot check is the guest's own ceiling: an
installed Windows desktop with no display driver paints at most 1824x1080 and, asked for more,
writes rows of its own width into a wider scanout - a sheared picture rather than a smaller
one. That limit belongs to the guest, not the machine, so it is documented rather than
enforced; a Linux guest on the same device drives 4K perfectly well.

**A provisioning disc in the guest's own language.** Every VM app gets a small read-only disc
built fresh on each launch. For a cloud-init guest it carries that guest's identity. A guest on
the compatible device profile has never heard of cloud-init, so the disc carries
`zinc-setup.cmd` instead: a generated batch file that stages the virtio drivers from the
virtio-win disc. This is where the host's reach ends. The drivers that lift such a guest off a
fixed screen size and an emulated disk can only be installed from inside it, by a user with an
administrator token, so the last step is handed over as something the guest can run rather than
as something the reader must retype. The disc is built whenever either guest needs it, from one
predicate, so turning cloud-init off does not silently take the script away too.

**Installation is how the base comes into being.** A guest with no cloud image is installed by
`zvr install`, which takes flags rather than an app name on purpose: an app pins its base by
digest, and a disk that does not exist yet has no digest. Install first, pin the result, then
author the app against it. That keeps the rule that a pinned base is never written to intact.
The install seeds its machine identity from the disk's own path, because it has no app name
yet and a shared placeholder would give every install on every host the same identity at the
one moment it matters most.

## 11. Host Surface (minimal)

Zinc adds almost nothing to the host. The moving parts:

| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| A Wayland compositor | owns the display; passes the socket in per app |
| A terminal emulator | drops into terminal/multiterminal apps on explicit launch |
| `zc` / `zcr` | two static binaries on `$PATH` - author and run apps |
| Rootless Podman + pasta | the container runtime and userspace networking |
| Pipewire (optional) | audio; the socket is passed in only on explicit grant |

Everything else runs inside containers. The host-side values a launch needs (Wayland and
runtime sockets, the theme bundle, the terminal emulator, the netfilter image) are resolved
from the environment in one place (the host adapter, section 13) into an explicit options
struct, so the argv-building code stays pure and testable. The environment variables:
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `ZINC_TERMINAL` (else `$TERMINAL`), `ZINC_THEME_BUNDLE`,
and `ZINC_NETFILTER_IMAGE` (overrides the default helper image tag).

## 12. Desktop integration (ZDE)

Desktop hotkeys, a launcher, session profiles, and the Nix home-manager wiring belong to
**ZDE** (the Zinc Desktop Environment), a separate project layered on Zinc. They are not part
of the Zinc 0.1 core and are intentionally out of scope for this document. Zinc is
compositor-agnostic on purpose, so it can be adopted piecemeal on any existing system.

---

## 13. Repo Layout

The shared library is `common/`, which holds the app schema, its validation, and the
config-inheritance resolver (`common/domain/schema`, `.../validate`, `.../inherit`). It is
pure - no I/O, and the resolver takes a loader from its caller rather than reading anything
itself - and its one dependency is the YAML codec, which the resolver needs because it merges
nodes rather than decoded structs (3.1). Both tools depend on it and validate identically. The runtime hexagon lives **inside**
`container/runner`; there is no separate shared runtime module.

```

**The runner is a hexagon** (ports and adapters), so a mechanism can be swapped by writing a
new adapter rather than editing call sites - the motivating case being network enforcement
(5.3), where "not pasta" later is one more adapter. The layers:

- **`domain/`** - pure model and policy (the derived-image policy, the launch options type).
  No I/O, no podman/nft/fs/env.
- **`ports/`** - the interfaces the application depends on: `Store`, `Runtime`,
  `ImageBuilder`, `ImageResolver`, and `NetEnforcer` (the network swap point), plus the
  neutral `Command` type a `NetEnforcer` emits and a `Runtime` executes.
- **`app/`** - the application service that orchestrates a launch through the ports. The
  single launch path.
- **`adapters/`** - the concrete edges: `podman` (Runtime/ImageBuilder/ImageResolver),
  `netenforce` (the pasta pod plus nft ruleset - the swap point), `fs` (YAML store + codec),
  `host` (environment to options).
- **`wire/`** - the composition root: the one place that imports every adapter and assembles
  them into an `app.Service`. The CLI calls it; nothing else names a concrete adapter.

The shared schema (`common`) is vendored into each tool, so every per-module container build
stays hermetic (no network, no sibling checkout at build time). The repo-root `go.work` ties
the modules together for local editing only; the build never depends on it (`make vendor`
runs with `GOWORK=off`).

Two distinct container concerns live here: the repo-root `Containerfile` reproducibly builds a
**tool binary** (pinned Go toolchain plus that module's vendored deps); the netfilter
`Containerfile` under `container/runner/images/netfilter` builds the **runtime helper image**
the network lock-down applies rules with (6.4).

## 14. Known Issues and Tradeoffs

| # | Issue | Mitigation |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | wayland-security-context enforcement is the compositor's, not Zinc's | the container boundary is the real wall (5.1); a VM (section 10) is the stronger boundary for untrusted GUI apps |
| 2 | GPU passthrough weakens isolation | off by default; never enable for untrusted images (5.4) |
| 3 | Image tags can be poisoned upstream | third-party images must be digest-pinned; launch is `--pull never` (5.5) |
| 4 | Derived images are per-machine, not digest-pinned | their guarantee is the pinned base plus the visible install lines (7) |
| 5 | Some schema fields are validated but not yet enforced at runtime (config mounts). Resources and internal user are enforced; notifications are refused outright rather than ignored | called out explicitly in section 3; on the roadmap, fail-loud where relevant |
| 6 | Host-scoped egress, gateway/multi-homing, and mixing a sibling link with other networking are unsupported | fail-closed: rejected at launch, never mis-enforced (6.5) |
| 7 | The netfilter helper runs with namespaced `CAP_NET_ADMIN` | namespaced to the pod's userns, harmless on the host; the image is local and `--pull never` (6.4) |
| 8 | VM apps have no egress filtering, only explicit port forwards | the nftables model lives in a container netns and does not reach a guest; rejected rather than mis-enforced (10) |

---

## 15. Status and Roadmap

**0.1 ships containers:** the schema and validation, the YAML app store, the full
`zc` + `zcr` split with a keyboard-first TUI, real rootless-container lifecycle, and the
fail-closed network lock-down (isolated / egress / LAN publish / sibling link).

**0.2 ships the launcher:** `zlt`, a keyboard-first fuzzy picker over the defined apps that
shells out to `zcr` (depends only on `common`, never imports the runtime).

**0.3 ships the GUI launcher** `zlg` over the reusable `menu` module, and **0.4 ships
virtualization**: `zvr` runs VM apps over qemu (section 10), and `zcc` became `zc` because one
creator now authors both app kinds. The ZDE desktop layer is a separate project in its
own repository (section 12), not a Zinc release. Within the container tools, the near-term
work is wiring the already-validated schema fields (resources, internal user) into the launch.
