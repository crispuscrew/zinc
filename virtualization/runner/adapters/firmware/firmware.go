// Package firmware prepares the two host-side pieces a Windows-class guest needs before

// Both are per-app on purpose. UEFI keeps boot entries in its variable store, and a TPM
// holds keys the guest believes are sealed to its own machine; sharing either between
// guests would let one app's state - or secrets - land in another.

// An OVMF build on the host. Secure Boot needs the matching pair: the code half carries the
// signature database, so a secboot VARS with plain CODE boots into an unusable state rather
// than a secured one.
//
// tpm records whether the build hands an attached TPM over to the guest, and it is the whole
// reason this is a table of builds rather than a list of paths. Distributions ship two
// generations side by side: a current 4 MB build, and a legacy 2 MB build kept for machines
// created before the variable store grew. Only the 4 MB build carries the TPM (Tcg2) driver.
// QEMU publishes the TPM's ACPI device by itself, so a guest on the legacy build still
// enumerates it and still binds a driver to it - it just never gets a working TPM behind it.
// Windows 11 reads version 0 from that and refuses to install, reporting only that the PC
// does not meet its requirements. Measured on Fedora 43 with edk2-ovmf 20260508: the 2 MB
// build reports TPMVersion 0 and a hard block, the 4 MB build reports 2 and no issue.
